Amikomers is an e-commerce platform that focuses on electronic goods, especially for PCs. In response to the pandemic situation and learning needs increasingly urgent online, we created Amikomers. This platform aims to provide solutions to students, especially university students Amikom to enable them to easily obtain the computer equipment needed for online lectures.

The Amikomers project is a personal project that I developed from the project Amicomp, which is a web programming course project in the 4th semester developed by 6 of my college classmates and myself as a team. Project Amicomp can be accessed [here](https://murqdan.github.io/amicomp/).

I tried to develop Amikomers myself to add several features such as login, cart and payment features so that this e-commerce website can to be better. Besides that, in terms of Amikomers website interface design, I designed it to be similar to the Amikom campus website, namely amikom.ac.id.
